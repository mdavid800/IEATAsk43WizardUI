# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current form application suffers from inconsistent state management where updates to form data are not reliably reflected in the preview JSON and export functionality. Users experience issues when making corrections to compliance problems highlighted by validation checks, as the state doesn't update consistently across different parts of the application. This feature will implement a robust state management solution using Zustand to ensure consistent, reliable state updates throughout the form wizard and export process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out the IEA Task 43 form, I want my form data to be consistently updated across all components, so that the preview JSON and export functionality always reflect my current input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates any form field THEN the global state SHALL be immediately updated
2. WHEN the global state is updated THEN all components consuming that state SHALL reflect the changes
3. WHEN a user navigates between form steps THEN the form data SHALL persist consistently
4. WHEN a user views the preview JSON THEN it SHALL display the current state of all form data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user correcting compliance issues, I want my corrections to be immediately reflected in validation checks and export functionality, so that I can see the impact of my changes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user corrects a validation error THEN the validation status SHALL update immediately
2. WHEN validation status changes THEN the step indicators SHALL reflect the updated status
3. WHEN a user attempts to export after making corrections THEN the export SHALL use the most current form data
4. WHEN form data is updated THEN any cached validation results SHALL be invalidated and recalculated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want a centralized state management solution, so that state updates are predictable and debugging is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state changes occur THEN they SHALL be managed through a single, centralized store
2. WHEN debugging state issues THEN developers SHALL have access to clear state update patterns
3. WHEN adding new form fields THEN the state management SHALL be easily extensible
4. WHEN state updates occur THEN they SHALL follow immutable update patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with complex nested form data (locations, loggers, sensors, measurements), I want updates to nested objects to be handled reliably, so that I don't lose data when editing complex structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates nested array items THEN the changes SHALL be persisted correctly
2. WHEN a user adds or removes items from arrays THEN the state SHALL update without affecting other items
3. WHEN a user updates deeply nested properties THEN the parent objects SHALL maintain their structure
4. WHEN nested updates occur THEN validation SHALL work correctly on the updated data structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the form to maintain performance even with complex state updates, so that the interface remains responsive during data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state updates occur THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
2. WHEN large datasets are managed THEN the application SHALL maintain responsive performance
3. WHEN multiple rapid updates occur THEN the state management SHALL handle them efficiently
4. WHEN components subscribe to state THEN they SHALL only re-render when their specific data changes
